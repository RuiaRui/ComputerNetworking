### problem 3

The one's complement of the sum is 01011101  11110011





### Problem 5 

If we divide 10011 into 1010101010  0000, we get 1011011100, with a remainder of R=0100.  Note that, G=10011 is CRC-4-ITU standard. 

### Problem 6 

a) we get 1000110000, with a remainder of R=0000. b) we get 0101010101, with a remainder of R=1111. c) we get 1011010111, with a remainder of R=1001.



### Problem 23  

 If all the 11=9+2 nodes send out data at the maximum possible rate of 100 Mbps, a total aggregate throughput of 11*100 = 1100 Mbps is possible.
